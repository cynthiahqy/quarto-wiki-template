## OAuth Authentication

This template also contains three non-quarto files:

-   `Dockerfile`
-   `email_list.txt` -- remember to modify this as per tutorial instructions
-   `render.yaml`

Use these files to serve this site semi-privately as described in this OAuth2 Proxy tutorial: - [hamelsmu/oauth-tutorial](https://github.com/hamelsmu/oauth-tutorial) - see my fork ([cynthiahqy/oauth-tutorial](https://github.com/cynthiahqy/oauth-tutorial)) for some slightly modified instructions based on my experience using a custom domain purchased via Netlify
